# is-fakedata

This dependency has the function of generating specific data, based on given properties 🚀.




## How to use it?

It's relatively easy 😎


```bash
  npm install is-fakedata
```
```bash
  import { createData } from 'is-fakedata'
```

The function initially receives many parameters, some are not mandatory, here I explain them to you 🙌.

![App Screenshot](	https://github.com/HansM7/is_fakedata/blob/master/function.png?raw=true)

```bash
  t -> It is the type of data you want 'users', 'animals'
  e -> It is the array of properties you want ['id', 'name'] or ['first_name']
  r -> It is the number of objects you need
  s -> It is optional, it is the file name
  o -> It is optional, but it is the file address
```

Ready, that's all! 😁
